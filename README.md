# Spring JPA Code Kata

The intent of this Kata is to practice working with relation database design.  This exercise entails defining various types of database constraints such as primary keys, compound primary keys, uniques constraints, and foreign key constraints.  In addition, the exercise will involve defining various types of relations between entities such as `One to One`, `One to Many`, and `Many to Many`.

The project comes with a set of Spring Boot tests and the minimal code needed for them to compile.  The goal of the exercise is to implement the code needed to get the tests to pass.  The project comes with a `compose.yaml` file that will spin up a PostGRES docker container.  This container must be running in order for the tests to pass.  When starting the kata, it is recommended to start with the `ProductTest` and then move on to the other tests once that one is green.

### Prerequisites 

This project requires the following tools to be installed.
* Java 21
* Docker

### The Domain Model

This project contains four domains: Catalog, Product, Inventory, and Category.  Catalog, Product, and Category are independent entities and can exist on their own.  Inventory requires the existence of a product for which the inventory data pertains.  Catalogs contain a collection or products and products can belong to multiple catalogs.  A category contains multiple products, but a product can only belong to one category.  Each product contains a sku which must be unique across all products and may have an optional inventory status associated with it. 

### A Word About Transactionals
A common practice for writing tests to validate the interactions between the application and the database is to write tests that spin up an in memory database and then use either the `@DataJpaTest` or the `@Transactional` annotations.  The benefits of these annotations is to keep tests independent and reliable.  This is accomplished by these annotations because they introduce logic that performs a rollback on the transaction at the end of each test rather than actually committing the results to the database.  However, unfortunately these annotations also slightly vary the behavior of the interactions of the application with database and as a result it is possible to write tests that pass only to have exceptions occur when the application is actually launched and connected to real database.  

For the purposes of the kata, the tests are written without using the `@DataJpaTest` and with only minimal use of the `@Transactional` annotations.  The tests do not spin up an in memory database and will rely on accessing an actual PostGRES database.  The tests are written this way so that tests behavior matches the behavior of the launched application.  After completing the kata, see the code contained within the `transactional` branch in this repository for examples of the issues of using the `@Transactional` annotation.  The tests leverage the `@Transactional` annotation.  Necessary code needed for persistence to actually work has been commented out in the `ProductEntity`, `CatalogEntity`, and `CategoryEntity` classes.  Even with the required code commented out, the tests will still pass.  In addition, one test that should pass fails due to the rollback logic preventing certain validation constraints from being performed.
